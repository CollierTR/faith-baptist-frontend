          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary">What is Biblical Counseling?</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Biblical Counseling is the process where the Bible, God's Word, is related individually to a person or persons who are struggling under the weight of personal sin and/or the difficulties with suffering, so that he or she might genuinely change in the inner person to be pleasing to God.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-4">Three Key Beliefs</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
              First, we believe that the Bible, given by God, is sufficient for life in that, when properly interpreted, it reveals to the believer all the data necessary for one to understand his need for Christ, how he can please the Lord, and how to live in a God-honoring way regardless of the circumstances whether comfortable or oppressive.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
              Second, the Bible is also the authoritative source with which all truth claims—including claims made by science and history—must be evaluated. As a result, we reject all counseling theories that use presuppositions, principles, and/or methodologies that are inconsistent with the proper interpretation of the biblical text.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
              Third, we believe that genuine heart change is totally dependent on the ministry of the Holy Spirit. Thus, our view of counseling practice includes the importance of prayer, dependence on God, a thorough knowledge of the Word of God, and an understanding of ministering to people.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Our church offers counseling by trained individuals to help people respond to life's problems from a Biblical perspective.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-4">What problems do you handle?</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
              We believe that the Bible is sufficient to address any problem. The most common issues are:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
              <li>Struggles in marriage</li>
              <li>Difficulties in parenting</li>
              <li>Sexual sin</li>
              <li>Emotional problems (anxiety, worry, anger, bitterness, and depression)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-4">What is the fee?</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
              Our counseling is free. We desire to help anyone in need.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-4">How do I set up an appointment?</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
              Email at <a href="mailto:brandon.m.rhea@gmail.com" class="text-primary hover:underline">brandon.m.rhea@gmail.com</a> or call <a href="tel:660-956-6253" class="text-primary hover:underline">660-956-6253</a>.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary mt-4">Why should I have hope?</h4>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
              The Bible teaches from Romans 15:4, “For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.” No matter how desperate your situation, the all wise, sovereign, loving God has answers.
